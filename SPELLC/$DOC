This data set contains an ISPF Edit command to spell check your data.

Members of this data set:

    $DOC     What you are reading
    $MORE    Information on where to find words to add to or create a
             public dictionary. The referenced URL refers to the web
             site for the Dictionaries for International Ispell which
             lists sources for words for most languages.
    WBAD     A small member that can be used to verify SPELLC where
             there are invalid words
    WGOOD    A small member that can be used to verify SPELLC
             where all words are valid.

             Alternate dictionaries can be created for other
             languages but only one installation dictionary is
             allowed at any point in time.

    The REXX Exec Library Members are:
    SPELLC   The ISPF Edit command written in REXX to do the Spelling
             verification
    SPELLCA  The ISPF Edit command written in REXX to add words to the
             users personal dictionary (thanks to Russ Nesbitt)
    SPELLCDF The ISPF Edit command default REXX exec
    SPELLCPN The REXX Exec that contains the dynamic versions of the
             ISPF panels and which will load them

    The ISPF Panel Library Members are:
    SPELLCD  The ISPF Panel to prompt for a user dictionary data set
    SPELLCH  The ISPF Help Panel
    SPELLCP  The ISPF PopUp Panel that displays the Spell Checking
             Progress

for their contributions to this package.
==================================================================

Installation:

    1. Copy dataset WORDS into a sequential data set that can be
       accessed by all TSO/ISPF users. A DCB of RECFM=VB LRECL=84
       is suggested.
    2. Edit member SPELLCDF and update as appropriate
       ** see Local Customization section below
    3. Copy member SPELLC, SPELLCA, and SPELLCDF into a CLIST or
       REXX library in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.
    4. If the panelloc value in SPELLCDF is non-null then Copy members
       SPELLCD, SPELLCH, and SPELLCP into an ISPF Panel library in your
       ISPPLIB concatenation, otherwise this step is not required.

==================================================================

Local Customization

All local customization should occur within the SPELLCDF REXX Exec,
however if you find something that needs changing elsewhere let me know.

The variables to set in SPELLCDF are:

    dictdsn      The data set name of the public dictionary
    email        The e-mail address to display in the first popup
                 panel as the address to send words to add to the
                 public dictionary (please set this to your address
                 and do not leave it as mine)
    alpha        The alphabet in upper case (may be customized
                 for NLS support)
    from         Special characters to be translated to blanks
                 before each line of words is processed
    panelloc     Determines if SPELLC will use the ISPF Panels
                 from an existing ISPPLIB library or if the Panels
                 should be dynamically loaded into a temporary
                 library and then LIBDEF'd to access them.
    other        Characters if found in a word cause the word
                 to be ignored (and thus assumed to be correctly
                 spelled)
    usrmodel     A data set name model to be used to allocate
                 the users personal dictionary if they have not
                 already done so. This is used in SPELLCA on its
                 first use if the personal dictionary variable
                 is null.

*** Note the nls variables will be supported in the future ***
==================================================================

Usage SPELLC:

SPELLC is an ISPF Edit macro that is invoked on the ISPF Edit command
line with or without any other parameters. It will prompt the user to
ask if the user has their own dictionary of words and which records to
spell check. There are also options to have a progress popup and to
ignore words that are in all caps.

Syntax:   SPELLC <optional-parameters>

      The optional parameters allowed are:

      Starting line number or label
      Ending line number or label

      If an ending line number or label is specified then a starting
      line number or label is required.

      An alternate way to specify a range of lines to check is to use a
      S followed by a number (e.g. S9 to check 9 lines) or a pair of SSs
      to mark a range.

If the user has their own dictionary then the words in it will be added to the
installation dictionary for the spelling check. A null data set name is
acceptable on this panel.

The spell checking is performed using the following 'rules':

    1. Each line of text in the ISPF Edit (or View) data set is read from
       top to bottom
    2. Each line will have the characters :,?()*=;<>|$ translated to blanks.
       See the from variable in SPELLCDF for the complete list
    3. Each word (a string of characters without an intervening blank)
       is then converted to upper case for checking
    4. Words that begin with numbers are not checked
    5. The word is tested and if found then checking continues
       with the next word, otherwise
       a. Words ending with S, 'S, and 'D are checked as if the S, 'S, and
          'D are not there.
       b. Words with these other characters 0123456789_-@ are ignored
    6. Upon completion the invalid words are displayed in sorted sequence
       at the top of the data set in ISPF message format.
    7. A message is inserted after each line with an invalid word indicating
       the misspelling on the prior line

==================================================================

Usage SPELLCA:

SPELLCA is an ISPF Edit command that will add words to the users personal
dictionary. To use:

    1. Enter SPELLCA on the ISPF Edit Command Line
    2. Move the cursor to the word to be added
    3. Press enter

This assumes that a personal dictionary has been defined. If one has not
been defined then a message indicating that is displayed.

==================================================================

User Dictionary

The user dictionary is any sequential data set or member of a partitioned data
set that conforms to the following format:

    1. records with * in column 1 are comments
    2. words are separated by blanks or on separate records

It is suggested that the dictionary be allocated using RECFM=VB LRECL=84
and that more than one word be on a record.
