* This is a word dictionary that is used by the SPELL ISPF Edit macro
* the case of the words can be upper or lower however the testing of
* the spelling is case insensitive
*
* As many words as will fit may be on any one record in this dictionary
* and a statement with an * in column 1 is a comment.
*
* If you put more than 1 word on a line you will still want to try to
* keep the list alphabetical so that it is easy to update/maintain. To
* do this use the TF (text flow) line command to flow the lines to 1
* word per line by using the TF2 line command.
*
* Then enter your new words anywhere after these comments.
*
* Then put a .A label on the first line with a word (after these
* comments) and enter SORT .A .ZL (sort from the .A line to the
* last line). Then do a TF76 on the first line of words.
*
* Words that begin with a non-alpha or have a non-alpha character within
* are not spell checked.
*
* Note that this dataset must be sequential. RECFM=FB LRECL=80 or
* RECFM=VB LRECL=84 are suggested.
