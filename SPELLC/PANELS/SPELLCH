`
%SPELLC`is an ISPF Edit Macro that will do a basic spelling verification on
`the file currently active in ISPF Edit. Note that the file does NOT have to
`be saved first.
`
`Before spelling verification begins each record is scanned and special
`characters are translated to blank. These characters include :,?()*=;<>Ý¨!
`after which each word will have all surrounding quotes ' and " removed as
`well as any trailing periods.
`
`The personal dictionary is any sequential data set, or PDS member, with a
`list of words separated by blanks on as many records as needed.
`
`The user can call the%SPELLC`command with a starting and ending line number
`or line label, or with no parameters. The%SPELLCA`command can be used to add
`a word to your personal dictionary by entering%SPELLCA`on the command line and
`placing the cursor on the desired word - then pressing enter.
`
`The spelling verification is not exhaustive but is an excellent start for
`those of us who need a little extra help with our spelling.
