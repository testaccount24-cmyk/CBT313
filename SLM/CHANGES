                      Fix the NEW option to create a new member.
                      Clean up help panels (such as they are)
                      Add REPORT option on each of the table display panels

                      Improve processing if the target datset has an error
                         on copy, rename, edit, or move.
                      Add saveloc option to determine for saveopt/saveoptu
                         options of 4, 6, and other (not 1,2,3,5) and the
                         member length is less than 8 then append the
                         save character instead of changing the last. If
                         length is 8 then change the last character.
                      If only one library do not execute the routine to
                         remove inactive members.
                      Add information to $doc and documentation about the
                         web based group and listserv.
