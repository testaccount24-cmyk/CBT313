`    TSO Mail Defaults are important as they provide the necessary information
`    for the proper processing of your mail.
`
`    Your%Name, Mailing address`and%Electronic address`will be used in the
`    messages that you send to others.
`
`    The current%Node`is used in the messages that you send to identify where
`    the message is originating.
`
`    Specifying that you want the outgoing messages to be%Logged`will cause
`    a copy of your messages to be placed into your TSO Mail table which will
`    allow you to resend them and/or print them.
`
`    Specifying whether you want your outgoing messages to be%Acknowledged`
`    will provide you with notification that your outgoing message has been
`    read by the recipient.
