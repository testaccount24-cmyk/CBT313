`
`    TSO Mail Processing is an extension to the standard IBM provided TSO
`    Transmit and Receive commands that provides full screen ISPF dialog
`    support for sending and receiving messages and files.
`
`    With this ISPF Dialog you have the ability to¬Open Mail`which will
`    receive all new messages and store the messages into an ISPF table.
`    It will also receive any data sets that have been sent to you and
`    store them as unique data sets pending further action by you.
`
`    The¬Send Mail`option simplifies the task of sending messages to
`    another user, either at the current NJE Node or at another location.
