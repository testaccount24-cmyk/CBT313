`    The option to retain 3 mail logs for diagnostic purposes is available if
`    you or your systems programmer suspect that you may be losing mail
`    because of some unique situation.  Since the mail table is built from the
`    mail logs, retaining copies will help with diagnosis.  The logs will be
`    suffixed HOLD1.LOG, HOLD2.LOG and HOLD3.LOG with a prefix of your userid
`    and a qualifier as defined by the installation.
`
`    The%Print`options are used to provide a fast path for printing of your
`    messages.  If the printer destination is blank then you will be prompted
`    by a print option selection menu that will allow you to specify several
`    different print options and printer types.
