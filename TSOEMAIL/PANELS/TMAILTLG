+-------------------% TSO/E-Mail Log Data Set Disposition +---------------------
%Option ===>_zcmd


`    Specify!D`to~delete`or!E`to~edit`your current TSO Mail LOG data set.

`    This is the first time that you have used the TSO/E ISPF Mail Dialog
`    and a pre-existing TSO Mail LOG data set has been detected.  This data
`    set must either be deleted or all old and/or unwanted messages should
`    be deleted before you continue with this dialog.  The reason is that
`    this LOG data set is used to record all messages which are Transmitted
`    or Received and this dialog will use this same data set to copy the
`    messages into an ISPF Table.  The LOG data set is then deleted once this
`    copy has been completed.
`
`    If you elect to continue without cleaning out all of the old and/or
`    unwanted messages the dialog make take a while to copy all of the
`    messages into the ISPF Table.
`
`    The default (PF3) is to continue with the complete LOG data set.
