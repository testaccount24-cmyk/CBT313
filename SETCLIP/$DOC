SetClip will perform two functions depending on how it is invoked.

Syntax:  %setclip option

Where option is:   blank     invokes the ISPF Dialog to define and setup
                             the user clipboards
                   non-blank to just setup the clipboards

When the option is blank an ISPF panel (setclipp) is displayed that
allows the user to define up to 10 (the IBM limit) Edit clipboards.

The panel requests both a clipboard name and the dataset, or dataset(member),
that contains the text that will be copied into the clipboard. If the start
and/or ending row numbers are not specified then all records will be copied
into the clipboard.

When ENTER is pressed the clipboard definitions will be saved and the user
clipboards will be updated or created.

The CANCEL command can be used to exit without saving updates.

PF3 exits the dialog and will create, or update, the clipboards if
changes have been made.

When the option is non-blank then the ISPF profile variables are read
and the clipboards created. This is to enable the ability to
automatically create the clipboards when ISPF Starts using the ZSTART
ISPF variable.  Use the SET command within this dialog to set, or update,
the ZSTART variable.

          To have the clipboards created every time ISPF
          starts update the ISPF Profile variable ZSTART to
          add:  tso %setclip x

Recommendation: Use the EDSET ISPF Edit command to verify that the CUT
operation defaults to REPLACE and PASTE defaults to KEEP.

Then exit ISPF and restart ISPF. Open ISPF Edit on a dataset and use the
CUT DISplay command to view the created clipboards.
