@  SETCLIP+is an ISPF dialog that makes it easy for a user to create from
+  one to ten (the ISPF max) ISPF Edit Clipboards from existing datasets
+  for use during the ISPF session.
+
+  Commands: @CANCEL+to not update the current definitions and exit
+             (Only works if Cancel is entered before the@Enter+key)
+            @SET+to update the ISPF Profile Variable ZSTART to cause
+             the clipboards to be set each time ISPF Starts
+
+  Line Options:@B+to browse the dataset
+               @D+to delete the selected row
+               @E+to edit the dataset
+
+  Clipboard name is any 1-8 character name for the user clipboard.
+
+  Dataset is the dataset, or dataset(member), where the clipboard data are
+  found.
+
+  Rows (optional) is the 1st and/or last row to be copied into the clipboard.
+
  @Enter+will save the current definitions and update/create the user
+  defined clipboards if there have been updates.
+
  @PF3+will save all updated information and create/update clipboards
+  before exiting.
+
  @Automate+the creation of the user clipboards by updating the ISPF
+  ZSTART variable with@TSO %SETCLIP X+to have the clipboards created
+  each time ISPF starts. Hint: Use the@SET+command within this dialog.
+
  @Notes:+ 1. When in ISPF Edit use the@CUT DISplay+command to
+             view active clipboards
+          2. If the rows entered are not valid then the set routine
+             will stop while in EDIT on the source dataset with an
+             error message
+          3. Use the ISPF Edit command EDSET to change/verify the
+             default actions for CUT and PASTE.
+             - Default for CUT is recommended to be be REPLACE
+             - Default for PASTE is recommended to be be KEEP
+          4. Clipboards named X and NX are not allowed as they
+             are CUT command options.
+
  @Suggestion:+Consider placing the records for multiple clipboards
+  into a single dataset, or dataset(member), and using the starting
+  and ending rows to select the records.
+
+ @Background+The clipboards are stored in memory, which means they are
+  discarded at TSO LOGOFF, but they remain if ISPF is just stopped and
+  restarted.  Thus, by using SETCLIP to define clipboards, and adding
+  SETCLIP to the ZSTART variable, clipboards with frequently used
+  information can be made available across ISPF sessions and TSO
+  LOGONs.
