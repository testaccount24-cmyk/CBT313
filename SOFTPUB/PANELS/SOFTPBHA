+    Tutorial for the Softcopy Publications Administration Application
+
+    This tutorial consists of the following sections:

     1.  Overview
     2.  Administration Applications
     3.  Upload Instructions
     4.  Dialog Elements

+ 1. Overview
+
+    This administration application is written to support the locally
+    developed ISPF front-end interface to the IBM BookManager Read/MVS
+    product.  It is written using standard ISPF services and is driven
+    using procedures written in TSO/E REXX.
+
+    The Rexx procedure SOFTPDFT contains variables that define the
+    high-level qualifier for the softcopy application and the names of the
+    production and build control data sets.  The control data sets are
+    partitioned and contain text and ISPF tables.
+
+ 2. Administration Applications
+
+    This application is intended to be used by selected individuals to
+    define and control the Softcopy Publications environment.  The following
+    options are available as part of this application:

    @1+ Build            Build the Softcopy ISPF Tables
+
+       This application will take the BUILD member of the Softcopy
+       Work ISPF Table data set and construct a set of ISPF tables
+       that are used by the SOFTPUB application that is the front-end
+       to the IBM provided BookManager/Read MVS application.
+
+       The BUILD will copy the BUILD member into a member name MASTER
+       and rename previous MASTER members as OMASTnnn for future
+       reference.
+
+       Table Name "SOFTCOPY" is the primary ISPF table that defines the
+       hierarchy of softcopy categories.  Sub-tables are of the format
+       SFTggnnn, where 'gg' is a generation qualifier so that COPY can
+       be performed without impacting a currently active user.  'nnn'
+       is a sequential number starting with 001 for each category
+       defined.
+
+   @2+ Review           Review Contents of Softcopy ISPF Tables
+
+       A simple ISPF and Rexx application to just display the work
+       control data set tables.  Simplier than the Test option to just
+       review what has been defined and built.
+
+   @3+ Test             Test the built tables
+
+       This option will invoke the softcopy Display application using
+       a special parm that causes it to use the Work ISPF table data
+       set.
+
+   @4+ Copy             Copy the built tables into Production
+
+       This option copies the current tables from the BUILD work data
+       set into the production data set.  Current minus 2 versions of
+       the tables are also removed.  Member GG is replaced which
+       defines the current generation of tables.
+
    @5+ Update Shelf     Update a Book Shelf (Edit)
+
+       Using ISPF Edit update a book shelf.
+
+
+   @6+ Collect          Collect a report of all Book Shelves for use in 5
+
+       This option will list all data sets under the defined high-level
+       index.  From this list all Book Shelves (.BKSHELF) are checked for
+
+       -  If the second qualifier is UPLOAD then the index file is
+          checked and the .BKSHELF is updated to reflect the correct
+          dsname for the index.  All Book names are also updated with
+          the correct index and suffix and the correct control
+          statement inserted into the .BKSHELF.
+       -  The title of the shelf is extracted and saved along with
+          the dsname in member REPORT of the work control data set.
+       -  Prior to saving the REPORT member, the previous REPORT member
+          is processed and compared to find any new book shelves.  If
+          new shelves are found then member NEWSHELF is created with
+          just the new shelves.  This member can then be copied into
+          member BUILD under the Construct option.
+
+   @7+ Update           Update the BUILD control member
+
+       Invokes ISPF Edit on the work control data set to allow the
+       administrator to update the BUILD member with new shelves from
+       member NEWSHELF - or to change the current BUILD member
+       structure.
+
+   @8+ Index Build      Invoke BookManager Read/MVS Index Utility
+
+       Invoke the IBM provided Book Manager Read/MVS Index creation
+       utility.
