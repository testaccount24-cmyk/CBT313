+ `  Tutorial for the Softcopy Publications Application
+
+    This application is a locally designed interface to IBM's BookManager
+    Read/MVS product.  It provides a more hierarchical structure for
+    accessing softcopy publications.
+
+    For more information on using the BookManager Read/MVS application
+    use HELP once you have selected a BookShelf and entered the
+    BookManager Read/MVS product.
+
+    Each row in the tables represent either a Category of softcopy
+    publications or a specific book shelf of softcopy publications.
+
+    A row is selected by one of the following methods:
+
+    1.  Move the cursor to anyplace on the row and press the ENTER key.
+
+    2.  Place any non-blank character in the selection field of the row
+        and then press the ENTER key.
+
+    A FIND can be performed on the current table to search for a specific
+    character string within the Category or Book Shelf title.  This is
+    accomplished by entering the following command on the ISPF Command
+    line:
+
+    FIND string
+
+    The word FIND can be abbreviated as F and the use of Repeat Find is
+    supported using the Repeat Find ISPF function key (&RFIND).  The
+    string must not be inclosed in quotes.  A successful find will cause
+    the cursor to be positioned on that line.  Use of Repeat Find will
+    move the cursor to the next occurance of the specified string.
+
+    For example, to find any book shelf referencing ISPF enter:
+
+                   F ISPF
+
+    Note that you can also do a find for a publication number.  For example
+    if you are looking for an IBM Publication numbered SC34-4258 you would
+    enter:
+
+                   F SC344258
+
+    The publication number does not appear in the displayed list of
+    publications but can be viewed by placing a 'V' on the row in the
+    selection field.  This is`only+valid when the display is from this
+    front end application.
+
+
+ `  Starting this application with selection options
+
+    This application can be started with the following ISPF command
+    and options from any place within ISPF:
+
+    BOOKMan options
+
+    Options that are currently supported are:
+
+ `  Find string
+
+       Find the specified string in the top level category list.
+      ~see below for a description of the string syntax
+
+ `  DFind string
+
+       Find the specified string in the list of all book shelves that also
+       includes any specific books included in a category.
+
+       The 'string' is broken into individual parts and each part is searched
+       for.  If all parts are found then the bookshelf is displayed.
+
+ `  DBfind string
+
+       Find the specified string in the list of all books.
+
+       The 'string' is broken into individual parts and each part is searched
+       for.  If all parts are found then the bookshelf is displayed.
+
+ `  Books
+
+       Start the application with the All Books list open.
+
+ `  Private
+
+       Start the application with the any private book shelves opened.
+       (these are shelves that are allocated under the users high level
+       prefix).
+
+ `   string syntax
+
+       A string consists of any characters that may appear in any
+       position within a publication title or publication number.
+       A string is entered without quotes or any other special
+       delimeter to allow those characters to be used in the search
+       string if desired.
+
+       Examples strings:
+
+       MVS/ESA
+       ~ will return all publications with MVS/ESA in their title
+
+       MVS ESA
+       ~ will return all publications with both MVS and ESA
+       ~ (with the blank in between) in their titles
+
+       GG24
+       ~ will return all publications with GG24 in their publication
+       ~ number (as you will probably not find that string in any title)
+
+ `  Publication Number information
+
+       Publication numbers are provided by the vendors with their
+       softcopy publications.  The format is xxxxxxxxss where
+       xxxxxxxx is the publication number and ss is the revision
+       code for the publication.
