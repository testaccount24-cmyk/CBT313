This file contains the Rockwell (now Kaiser) front-end to IBM's
BookManager Read/MVS and is provided with not guarentee.  If you use it
you should review it completely so that you understand it before
installing for production use.

The BMPRIMER in this PDS is a document written by Doug Adams, who was
a very good friend and co-worker at Rockwell International.

This application has been non-Rockwellized and has been Kaiserized
so that it will work at my new employeer.

Note:  I have changed jobs since I first released this application.  My

>>>Overview.

The IBM BookManager Read/MVS product is intended to display lists of softcopy
publications and then individual softcopy publications.  It provides a 3 level
hierarchy (Library Shelf -> Shelf -> Book).

The Rockwell front-end provides an unlimited (but not to exceed in total 999)
levels via a replacement for the Library Shelf known as Categories.  Categories
may be nested and within a Category a Shelf, Book or sub-Category may be
defined.  The IBM Read/MVS is invoked when a user selects either a Shelf or a
Book for processing.

There are two (2) elements to this front-end, a User Application and an
Administrative Application which are described below.

Access restrictions can be built into the application using information
extracted by a Rockwell unique routine to extract the users department
from the ACF2 data base.

This application is written using TSO/E REXX and ISPF dialog elements.

>>>Installation.

This file contains the following members:

   $DOC        Brief doc of what you are receiving
   DOC         Some documentation on the application that our Tech Pubs
               staff uses.
   EXEC        REXX execs used by the dialog
   MSGS        ISPF Messages
   PANELS      ISPF Panels
   SKELS       ISPF Skeleton
   TABLE       Sample build table dataset

All Members are in TSO XMIT format.  Issue a TSO RECEIVE
INDS(dsn(member)) to convert the data into a usable dataset.

>>>User Applications.

The user interface to BookManager Read/MVS will be via the
SOFTPUB exec instead of the BOOKMGR clist.  This is simplified by the addition
of a command to the ISPF Command table (documented below).

Command syntax from the ISPF command line is:

   BOOKMAN  option

   where option is:   null for the normal display of all categories that the
                      user is authorized to view.

           DEfault to display the DEFAULT Category

           PRivate to display the users private shelf
           OWn is an alias of Private

           FInd xxx   - find the character string in the primary list
           DFind xxx  - find the character string in the default all shelf list
           DBFind xxx - find the character string in the default all book list

1. Overview

   This administration application is written to support the locally
   developed ISPF front-end interface to the IBM BookManager Read/MVS
   product.  It is written using standard ISPF services and is driven
   using procedures written in TSO/E REXX.

   The Rexx procedure SOFTPDFT contains variables that define the
   high-level qualifier for the softcopy application and the names of the
   production and build control data sets.  The control data sets are
   partitioned and contain text and ISPF tables.

2. Administration Applications

   This application is intended to be used by selected individuals to
   define and control the Softcopy Publications environment.  The following
   options are available as part of this application:

   1+ Build            Build the Softcopy ISPF Tables

      This application will take the BUILD member of the Softcopy
      Work ISPF Table data set and construct a set of ISPF tables
      that are used by the SOFTPUB application that is the front-end
      to the IBM provided BookManager/Read MVS application.

      The BUILD will copy the BUILD member into a member name MASTER
      and rename previous MASTER members as OMASTnnn for future
      reference.

      Table Name "SOFTCOPY" is the primary ISPF table that defines the
      hierarchy of softcopy categories.  Sub-tables are of the format
      SFTggnnn, where 'gg' is a generation qualifier so that COPY can
      be performed without impacting a currently active user.  'nnn'
      is a sequential number starting with 001 for each category
      defined.

   2+ Review           Review Contents of Softcopy ISPF Tables

      A simple ISPF and Rexx application to just display the work
      control data set tables.  Simplier than the Test option to just
      review what has been defined and built.

   3+ Test             Test the built tables

      This option will invoke the softcopy Display application using
      a special parm that causes it to use the Work ISPF table data
      set.

   4+ Copy             Copy the built tables into Production

      This option copies the current tables from the BUILD work data
      set into the production data set.  Current minus 2 versions of
      the tables are also removed.  Member GG is replaced which
      defines the current generation of tables.

   5+ Update Shelf     Update a Book Shelf (Edit)

      Using ISPF Edit update a book shelf and then once the shelf
      has been saved it is transmitted to the other softcopy
      centers using MVS/BDT.


   6+ Collect          Collect a report of all Book Shelves for use in 5

      This option will list all data sets under the defined high-level
      index.  From this list all Book Shelves (.BKSHELF) are checked for

      -  If the second qualifier is UPLOAD then the index file is
         checked and the .BKSHELF is updated to reflect the correct
         dsname for the index.  All Book names are also updated with
         the correct index and suffix and the correct control
         statement inserted into the .BKSHELF.
      -  The title of the shelf is extracted and saved along with
         the dsname in member REPORT of the work control data set.
      -  Prior to saving the REPORT member, the previous REPORT member
         is processed and compared to find any new book shelves.  If
         new shelves are found then member NEWSHELF is created with
         just the new shelves.  This member can then be copied into
         member BUILD under the Construct option.

   7+ Update           Update the BUILD control member

      Invokes ISPF Edit on the work control data set to allow the
      administrator to update the BUILD member with new shelves from
      member NEWSHELF - or to change the current BUILD member
      structure.

   8+ Index Build      Invoke BookManager Read/MVS Index Utility

      Invoke the IBM provided Book Manager Read/MVS Index creation
      utility.

   9+ Usage Report     Generate Softcopy Usage Reports

      This option will generate a series of report files that
      identify all softcopy files that are (1) installed,
      (2) referenced, and (3) unreferenced.  A DCF tag'd file
      is prepared with all referenced file names for reporting
      and a REXX procedure is generated to delete all unreferenced
      files.

  10+ Bulk Xmit        Transmit a 1 or more files to other centers

      Allow the Softcopy administrator to transmit one or more data sets
      to the other softcopy centers using MVS/BDT.

  11+ Xmit File        Transmit a single file to other centers

      Allow the Softcopy administrator to transmit a single file
      to the other softcopy centers using MVS/BDT.

  12+ Collect          Collect a file of all softcopy files

      Collect a file of all softcopy for use in the os/2 command
      procedure to identify new and/or revised softcopy publications.


>>>Book Upload Instructions.

  All softcopy elements must be uploaded using the following defaults:

  File    Data     DCB                  Dsname
  Type    Type     Recfm Lrecl Blksize  Format
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Shelf   Text     VB    256   6233     ABOOK.UPLOAD.name.BKSHELF
  Book    Binary   FB   4096   8192     ABOOK.name.BOOK
  Index   Binary   FB   4096   8192     ABOOK.name.BKINDEX

  Using TCP/IP FTP:
  ftp mvs-host-name
  ..enter your userid when prompted
  ..enter your password when prompted
  >cd 'abook'
  >nmap $1.$2 UPLOAD.$1.BKSHELF
  >mput *.bks
  >nmap $1.$2 $1.BOOK
  >binary
  >site recfm=fb,lrecl=4096,blksize=8192 pri=300 sec=300 tr
  >mput *.boo
  >nmap $1.$2 $1.BKINDEX
  >mput *.bki
  >quit

  Here is a sample OS/2 command file that can be used to start the
  ftp upload processes for multiple nodes:

   del w1
   del s1
   del s2
   start "wcc1" ftp wcc1a.rockwell.com < ftpupld.txt > w1
   start "swc1" ftp swc1.rockwell.com < ftpupld2.txt > s1
   start "swc2" ftp swc2.rockwell.com < ftpupld2.txt > s2

  Note that some Books and Book Indexes may exceed the default file
  allocation size.  In this case it is easier to preallocate the data
  set using ISPF and then the upload will use that allocation.

>>>Local Dependencies

   SOFTDFT sets local defaults

   SHOWTSO is a local TSO command that returns information into rexx
           and clist variables from various system and local control
           blocks.  This is not included with this file as it is very
           much a Rockwell unique implementation.
           It is used to identify the current NJE node and to identify
           the users department/group (from the ACF2 Logonid record).
           You should be able to do these things with your own rexx
           code.  ** currently not used **

   SOFTPBC Exec submits a batch job to delete obsolete ISPF tables
           and uses a local job card structure and the PDSTOOLS PDS
           command.

>>>Dialog Elements

ISPF Commands:      The following commands must be added to the
                    ISPCMDS command table by the ISPF administrator:
