This dataset contains the elements of the Softcopy front-end
application.  To use this issue a TSO RECEIVE for each member (except
this one, member EXEC and PANELS) to create the necessary target
datasets, including documentation.

OR execute member $RECEIVE to create individual datasets.

I now use the Softcopy Librarian to upload and manage the softcopy
files.  The Collect step will compare what is in the softcopy table
with the newly updated BKLSHELF from the softcopy librarian.
