TXT2CSV is a simple REXX exec that works with both z/OS and z/VM to convert a
sequential dataset, or PDS member, to a new output file in CSV format.

If under z/OS ISPF then an ISPF panel can be invoked to assist with filling in
all the options required for TXT2CSV to operate.

The contents of this PDS are:

   Members:

      $DOC     - this member
      $RECV    - Exec to Receive the ISPF EXEC anbd PANELS libraries
      LICENSE  - GPL License
      PANELS   - TSO Transmit of the ISPF Panels
      REXX     - RUNC REXX Library in TSO Transmit
      SUPPORT  - Statement of Support

Installation:

Execute the $RECV exec to create EXEC and PANELS libraries

Installation:
   1. Copy the restored EXEC member into your SYSEXEC (or SYSPROC) library
   2. Copy the restored PANELS members into your ISPPLIB library

Notes:
   1. Thanks to :hilippe Lignot for the ISPF panel which I've enhanced and
      added a tutorial panel to it.
   2. The installation process is now similar to what I use for other
      ISPF dialogs that I distribute.
