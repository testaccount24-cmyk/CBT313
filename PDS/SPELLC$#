You can find more words to fill your dictionary at:

   http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell-dictionaries.html

Be careful - some of the files have over 300,000 words - many of which
will *never* be used by anyone (unless they are doing a crossword puzzle)
and having them in your public dictionary will just slow the loading of
the dictionary down.

The best way to use these is to upload the words you select from these
dictionaries to your z/os host into a sequential data set. After upload
use ISPF Edit on them and do the following:

1. Exclude All
2. On the line number enter UC to upper case all words
3. Flip  (to expose all words)
4. On the top line enter TF (text flow) so that as many words as
   possible will be on each line
5. You now have your dictionary

If you wish to merge this set of words with a current dictionary do the
following after upload:

1. Edit the current dictionary of words
2. On the command line enter COPY data-set-name where the file is that
   you uploaded
3. On the command line enter Exclude All
4. In the row selection field enter UC to upper case all words
5. On the first line in the selection field enter TF2 (text flow to
   column 2) which should flow all words so there is only one word per line
6. On the command line enter SORT
7. If you have a copy around of the command to remove duplicates use it
   (http://home.flash.net/~mzelden/mvsfiles/deldups.txt by Mark Zeldon
    is a good one if you need it)
8. On the first line in the selection field (numbers) enter TF (text
   flow) to place as many words as possible on each line
9. You now have your dictionary
