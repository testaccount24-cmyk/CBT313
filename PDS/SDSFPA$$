To install you need to:

1.  Unzip (which you obviously have done since you are reading
this)
2.  Upload sdsfpage.xmit to your MVS system using the following
    characteristics
    - binary
    - RECFM=FB
    - LRECL=80
3.  After the upload issue on TSO:
    RECEIVE INDS(upload.dsn)

then read the $doc member of the resulting PDS.

local requirements)
