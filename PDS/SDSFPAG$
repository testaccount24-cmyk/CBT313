SDSFPAGE is an ISPF Edit macro dialog that works with
SDSF to select specific pages for browsing, printing,
copy to data set, or e-mail. The user enters SDSF and
then invokes the SDSF Editor (SE selection command) on
a job or ddname and then enters SDSFPAGE to be prompted
for what pages to select.  Works with both ASA and
Machine carriage control spool files. (finalized just
today)
